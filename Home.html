                    This website was created in Bellarmine's CS311 class. It is dedicated to famous musical composers. Who thoughout time have created works that have    
                    made everlasting impressions in history. The website covers the lives and works of Bizetr, Mozart, Puccini, Verdi, and Wagner. The website was created suing the bootstrap
                    framwork and a css grid. <br><br>
                    “He took his pain and turned it into something beautiful. Into something that people connect to. And that's what good music does. <br>
                    It speaks to you. It changes you.” ― Hannah Harrington, Saving June
